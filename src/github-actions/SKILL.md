# GitHub Actions Skill

Generate production-grade workflows with security and maintainability baked in.

## Core Principles

GitHub Actions runs untrusted code with access to secrets, deployment credentials, and repo write permissions. Every default here minimises blast radius when something goes wrong.

### 1. Pin actions by full SHA, not tag

Tags are mutable; a compromised upstream can push malicious code to an existing tag. SHA pinning makes workflows reproducible and tamper-resistant.

```yaml
# Good - SHA-pinned with readable comment
- uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2

# Acceptable - tag with reminder to pin
- uses: actions/checkout@v6 # TODO: pin to SHA

# Bad - bare tag, no reminder
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

Always keep the human-readable tag as an inline comment.

**Get current SHAs** from the action's GitHub releases page (e.g. `https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases`). If you can't check, use the tag with `# TODO: pin to SHA` and tell the user. Recommend Renovate or Dependabot for the `github-actions` ecosystem.

**Never fabricate SHAs** - a wrong SHA silently fails at checkout. If unsure, use the tag.

**Immutable actions (2026):** GitHub now supports publishing actions as immutable OCI packages to ghcr.io via `actions/publish-immutable-action`. Tags on immutable actions can't be overwritten once published (infrastructure-level protection against tag hijacking, e.g. the March 2026 trivy-action incident). Reference by immutable tag when consuming; consider immutable publishing for your own actions.

**Action allowlisting (Feb 2026):** Repo/org admins can restrict permitted actions and reusable workflows on all plans. Recommend enabling as an additional layer beyond SHA pinning.

### 2. Least-privilege permissions

Declare top-level `permissions` and restrict to what's needed. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has broad write access.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

Grant more at the job level if specific jobs need it (publishing, releases), not workflow-level.

### 3. Explicit shell and failure behaviour

Set `defaults.run.shell: bash` at workflow level (not `sh`) for `set -eo pipefail` semantics by default.

```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash
```

### 4. Concurrency control

Prevent wasted runner minutes on superseded pushes:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

Disable `cancel-in-progress` for deploys - you don't want a half-deployed state.

### 5. Secrets and environment variables

- Never echo secrets or use them in `if:` conditions (leaks into logs).
- Prefer GitHub Environments with protection rules for deployment secrets.
- OIDC federation over long-lived credentials for cloud deploys. See OIDC reference.

### 6. Artifact attestations

Signed build-provenance attestations for anything publishing artifacts (binaries, images, packages):

- `actions/attest-build-provenance` signs with Sigstore-backed SLSA provenance - Build Level 2 by default, Level 3 with reusable workflows.
- Consumers verify with `gh attestation verify`.
- Container images: `actions/attest` with the image digest.

### 7. Script injection prevention

Never interpolate `github.event.*` directly into `run:` blocks. PR titles, issue bodies, branch names, and commit messages are attacker-controlled.

```yaml
# DANGEROUS - attacker controls PR title
- run: echo "PR: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"

# SAFE - pass through env (auto-quoted)
- run: echo "PR: $PR_TITLE"
  env:
    PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
```

### 8. Caching

Ecosystem-native caching first:

| Stack | Caching |
| --- | --- |
| Python | `actions/setup-python` with `cache: 'pip'` |
| Node | `actions/setup-node` with `cache: 'npm'` (or `pnpm`, `yarn`) |
| Docker | `docker/build-push-action` with `cache-from` / `cache-to` (GHA cache backend) |
| Generic | `actions/cache` with a well-chosen key |

### 9. Timeouts

Set `timeout-minutes` on every job. The default is 360 (6 hours) - silently burns minutes allocation.

---

## Workflow Structure

When creating a new workflow, use this skeleton and adapt:

```yaml
name: <descriptive-name>

on:
  # Choose triggers appropriate to the workflow purpose.
  # See "Trigger Patterns" below.

permissions:
  contents: read

defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true  # false for deploy workflows

jobs:
  <job-name>:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # or see "Runner Selection"
    timeout-minutes: 15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6 # TODO: pin to SHA
      # ... remaining steps
```

### Trigger Patterns

Choose triggers based on workflow purpose:

| Purpose | Triggers |
|---|---|
| CI (test on every change) | `push:` (branches), `pull_request:` (branches) |
| Deploy to staging | `push:` to `main` / `develop` |
| Deploy to production | `release:` (types: [published]), or manual `workflow_dispatch:` |
| Scheduled tasks | `schedule:` (cron) |
| Manual / parameterised | `workflow_dispatch:` with `inputs:` |
| Reusable (called by others) | `workflow_call:` with `inputs:` and `secrets:` |

For `pull_request`, prefer listing specific `types:` and `paths:` to avoid
unnecessary runs.

### Runner Selection

- Default to `ubuntu-latest` unless there's a reason not to.
- Matrix builds for multi-OS/version testing.
- Self-hosted runners: always a custom label, `runs-on: [self-hosted, <label>]`. Never bare `self-hosted` - security risk if you have multiple pools with different trust levels.

---

## Matrix Builds

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false  # let all combinations finish
  matrix:
    python-version: ['3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    exclude:
      - os: windows-latest
        python-version: '3.10'
    include:
      - os: ubuntu-latest
        python-version: '3.13'
        experimental: true
```

**Quote version strings that look like floats** (`'3.10'` not `3.10` - YAML parses the latter as `3.1`). Very common mistake.

Use `continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.experimental || false }}` for experimental entries that shouldn't fail the build.

---

## Reusable Workflows

For sharing logic across repos or reducing duplication:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/reusable-test.yml
name: Reusable Test

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      python-version:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      DEPLOY_KEY:
        required: false

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6 # TODO: pin to SHA
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6 # TODO: pin to SHA
        with:
          python-version: ${{ inputs.python-version }}
          cache: pip
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: pytest
```

Called via:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: '3.12'
    secrets: inherit  # or pass individually
```

Key constraints:
- Nesting up to 10 levels deep (raised from 4 in Nov 2025).
- Max 50 reusable workflows per caller (raised from 20 in Nov 2025).
- `env` context doesn't propagate to the called workflow.
- Private-repo reusable workflows are same-repo only unless the repo's Actions settings allow otherwise.

---

## Composite Actions

For reusable steps (smaller than a workflow):

```yaml
# .github/actions/setup-project/action.yml
name: Setup Project
description: Install dependencies and configure environment

inputs:
  python-version:
    description: Python version to use
    required: false
    default: '3.12'

runs:
  using: composite
  steps:
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v6 # TODO: pin to SHA
      with:
        python-version: ${{ inputs.python-version }}
        cache: pip
    - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      shell: bash
```

Composite actions require `shell:` on every `run:` step - no `defaults.run.shell`.

---

## Custom Actions

### JavaScript Actions

For rich GitHub API interaction or complex logic:

```
my-action/
├── action.yml
├── src/
│   └── index.js
├── dist/
│   └── index.js      # bundled with ncc
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

The `action.yml` points at the bundled file:

```yaml
name: My Action
description: Does the thing
inputs:
  token:
    description: GitHub token
    required: true
runs:
  using: node20
  main: dist/index.js
```

Bundle with `@vercel/ncc` and commit `dist/` (or use a build-and-release workflow).

### Docker Actions

For tools/runtimes not on the runner, or a fully isolated environment:

```yaml
name: My Docker Action
description: Runs in a container
inputs:
  config:
    description: Path to config file
    required: true
runs:
  using: docker
  image: Dockerfile
```

Docker actions only run on Linux runners.

---

## Self-Hosted Runners

For private network access, GPU, specialised hardware, or cost control:

- Custom labels: `runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, gpu]`.
- Ephemeral runners (recreated per job) strongly preferred - persistent runners accumulate state and credentials across jobs.
- Runner groups with repo access policies to limit which repos use which runners.
- For Kubernetes scaling, point to Actions Runner Controller (ARC).

---

## Common Workflow Recipes

Read `references/recipes.md` for full examples. It covers:

- Python CI (pytest, linting, type checking)
- Docker build and push (to GHCR and Docker Hub)
- Perl CI (multiple Perl versions via `shogo82148/actions-setup-perl`)
- Multi-platform container builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Release automation (changelog, GitHub Release, artifact upload)
- Terraform plan/apply with OIDC
- Dependabot auto-merge for minor/patch updates
- Scheduled vulnerability scanning
- Deploy to cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) via OIDC

---

## Debugging Failing Workflows

1. **Read the error carefully** - most failures are in the message.
2. **Common gotchas:**
   - YAML version strings parsed as floats (`3.10` → `3.1`).
   - Missing `permissions` for the token in use.
   - `${{ }}` in `if:` is always cast to string; use `== 'true'` or `== true` deliberately.
   - `actions/checkout` defaults to shallow clone; some tools need `fetch-depth: 0`.
   - Env vars set in one step aren't available in another unless written to `$GITHUB_ENV`.
   - Secrets unavailable in forked PR workflows (by design).
3. **`ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`** for opaque failures: set the repo secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to `true` for verbose logging.
4. **`gh run view --log-failed` can be useless.** On workflows with a fan-in/aggregator job, it may return only that job's log, not the log of the job that actually failed. `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/jobs/<job-id>/logs` gets the real per-job log.

---

## CI Traps (Silent Failures)

None of these error. The workflow stays green, or stays plausible, while doing something other than what it says - each was hit and verified in one day's CI work on a fork.

1. **A cache whose restore key never matches its save key freezes forever.** `restore: key: test-durations` against `save: key: test-durations-${{ github.run_id }}` never matches, falls back to prefix search, and GitHub caches are immutable - so every run lands on the *oldest* surviving entry. A month of runs planned their test sharding against one blob created a month earlier, and the symptom looked like health (byte-identical slices) rather than staleness. **Check:** confirm the restore key can actually match a saved key, and log the restored file's age or hash so staleness is visible.

2. **`merge-multiple: true` flattens artefacts that share a filename.** Eight shards each uploading `test_durations.json` produced a "merged" artefact holding one shard's worth, no collision warning. Give each shard's artefact a distinct filename, or download without merging and combine deliberately.

3. **`cancel-in-progress` makes concurrent dispatches eat each other.** `concurrency: { group: x-${{ github.ref }}, cancel-in-progress: true }` means several `workflow_dispatch` runs against the same ref cancel each other. Dispatching eight runs to characterise a 1-in-6 flake returned seven cancellations and one usable result - and a cancelled run isn't a failed run, so the sample looked clean rather than incomplete. **To sample a flake, dispatch serially:** wait for each run to finish before starting the next.

4. **On a fork whose PRs target upstream, `on: pull_request` never fires.** No PR exists *within* the fork, so nothing triggers it. Combined with `push: branches: [main]`, feature branches get no CI at all - and because the run list is simply empty rather than red, nobody notices. Add `push` on the branches you actually develop on, or `workflow_dispatch`, and confirm a run appears before trusting the absence of red.

5. **Upstream repos gate first-time contributors.** The PR's run sits at `conclusion: action_required` awaiting a maintainer's approval, and no check runs attach - `gh pr checks` reports "no checks reported", which reads like a misconfiguration on your side. It is not; nothing on the contributor's side can change it. Read the run's `conclusion` field rather than debugging the workflow file.

6. **Never re-run an existing CI run to gather evidence.** A re-run overwrites that run's recorded conclusion, destroying the historical record you were trying to read (one agent flipped a green run to red this way while building a control). Dispatch a *new* run instead.

## Security Checklist

When reviewing or generating a workflow, verify:

- [ ] `permissions:` declared at workflow level (restrictive)
- [ ] Actions pinned by SHA with tag comment
- [ ] No secrets in `if:` conditions or `echo` statements
- [ ] `pull_request_target` used carefully (if at all) - explain the risks
      if the user asks for it
- [ ] Third-party actions are from trusted publishers or audited
- [ ] `timeout-minutes` set on every job
- [ ] Concurrency group set appropriately
- [ ] OIDC preferred over static cloud credentials
- [ ] Self-hosted runner labels are specific, not bare `self-hosted`
- [ ] Production deployments use GitHub Environments with protection rules
      (required reviewers, wait timers, branch/tag constraints)
- [ ] Consider repository rulesets for branch protection over legacy branch
      protection rules (rulesets are more composable and can be org-wide)
- [ ] Untrusted input (`github.event.*`) is never interpolated directly into
      `run:` blocks — always passed through `env:` variables
- [ ] Published artifacts have signed provenance attestations
      (`actions/attest-build-provenance`)
- [ ] Action allowlisting is enabled at org or repo level (if applicable)

---

## Output Format

1. YAML with a `name:` field.
2. Inline comments on non-obvious choices.
3. Suggest a filename for `.github/workflows/` files (lowercase, hyphenated: `ci.yml`, `deploy-prod.yml`).
4. Custom actions: output the full directory structure with all required files.
5. Complex setups: prose explanation first, then YAML.
