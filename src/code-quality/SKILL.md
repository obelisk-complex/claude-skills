# Code Quality

Defines how to write, review, and architect code - applies to every language. The user isn't a professional developer and relies on you for sound architectural decisions without shortcuts. Treat every piece of code as if it will run unattended in production, because it probably will.

### Guiding principle: the end user's experience is paramount

When two valid approaches compete, pick the one that produces a better experience for the person who will use the software even if it's harder to implement. Never optimise for your own convenience at the user's expense.

---

## Core principles (higher wins on conflict)

### 1. Security is non-negotiable

- **Validate all external input.** Network data, file contents, env vars, CLI args - anything crossing a trust boundary gets validated before use.
- **Least privilege.** Processes, files, DB users, API tokens - minimum permissions to function. Never root/admin when not strictly necessary.
- **Never hardcode secrets.** Credentials, API keys, tokens, sensitive config in env vars or secrets manager - never source, comments, or committed config.
- **Allowlists over denylists.** Permit known-good rather than blocking known-bad.
- **Parameterised queries and templating.** No string concatenation for SQL, shell, HTML output, or any injection-prone context.
- **Cryptography: established libraries, never roll your own.** Current algorithms, current key sizes, highest-level abstraction available (`libsodium` over raw OpenSSL primitives).
- **Audit dependency security** - maintenance status, known vulnerabilities, attack surface.
- **Pin to exact versions** and commit lockfile; verify lockfile integrity in CI. Prevents silent upgrades from introducing malicious code.
- **Verify package provenance.** Name exactly as expected (typosquatting: `requets` vs `requests`), owner matches expected maintainer, package scoped to correct namespace/registry.
- **Prefer scoped packages** (`@org/pkg` in npm, namespaced in Python) to avoid dependency confusion where a public package shadows an intended private one.

Network-touching or background code gets extra scrutiny: rate-limit endpoints, timeouts on all network calls, bind to localhost unless external access is required, clean shutdown paths.

### 2. Efficiency: least code, fewest resources

Not premature optimisation - just not being wasteful by default.

- **No duplicated work.** Compute or fetch once, pass through. Never retrieve the same data twice when it can be cached or stored in a variable.
- **No hardcoded values.** Configuration, thresholds, paths, URLs into constants/config/env vars. Group related config in one clear location.
- **Prefer standard library.** Don't pull dependencies for something a few stdlib lines can do. But when a well-maintained library handles significant functionality, edge cases you'd otherwise miss, or complex error-prone logic - recommend it and explain why it's the better choice.
- **Efficient data structures and algorithms.** Right collection type for the access pattern. Avoid O(n²) when O(n log n) or O(n) exists without much more complexity. Watch operations inside loops.
- **Minimise allocations in hot paths.** Reuse buffers, stream over loading entire files, use generators/iterators where appropriate.
- **Clean up resources.** Close file handles, DB connections, sockets, temp files. Use the language's idiomatic resource management (`with`, `defer`, `using`, RAII, `try-finally`). Never rely on GC for resource cleanup.

### 3. Maintainability: easy to change later

Since the user isn't a professional developer, the code must be especially clear.

- **Meaningful names.** Describe purpose. Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood in the domain (`url`, `id`).
- **Small, single-purpose functions.** Each does one thing. A function needing a comment to explain *what* it does should probably be two functions with descriptive names. Exception: if profiling shows function boundaries are a measurable bottleneck in a hot path, consolidate. Performance wins trump purity when backed by evidence.
- **Flat over nested.** Early returns, guard clauses, pipelines over deep conditionals. Restructure when indentation exceeds three levels.
- **Separation of concerns.** IO, business logic, presentation stay separate. A function that calculates shouldn't also print or write.
- **Consistent patterns.** Within a project, handle errors the same way, structure modules the same way, name things the same way. Consistency beats individual cleverness.
- **Design for extension.** Composition over inheritance. Interfaces/traits to define boundaries. Structure so new features don't require modifying existing logic.

## Error handling

Three-tier approach:

### Development: fail fast, crash loudly
Assertions, panics, unhandled exceptions on invariant violations. Every error message includes what operation failed, the inputs, and why it's unexpected.

### Production, fatal errors: surface for bug reports
Unrecoverable state, missing critical resources, security violations → clear user-readable message and what the user should do (usually: report the issue). Include a reference ID or timestamp for log correlation. Never expose stack traces, internal paths, or implementation details to end users.

### Production, non-fatal errors: log and continue
Transient network failures, malformed optional data, recoverable state → small human-readable log file in an obvious, accessible location. Each entry: timestamp, brief description, enough context to diagnose. Rotate or cap the log.

Log format: one or two lines per entry, plain text. No complex structured formats unless the project already uses one. The user must be able to open it and understand what happened.

### Security-critical errors: fail closed
Authentication, authorisation, input validation, cryptographic operations → deny by default, don't log and continue. A timeout on an auth check means "denied", not "skip the check". Fail-closed takes precedence over the non-fatal tier for any error affecting a trust boundary. If unsure whether an error is security-sensitive, fail closed.

## Comments and documentation

- **Comment complicated sections inline - explain *why*, not *what*.** The code shows what happens; the comment explains reasoning.
- **When a fix exists because of a specific failure, name the failure and cite where it happens.** A comment carrying an argument is load-bearing: a later editor tidying up has to delete the argument deliberately, whereas a bare assertion reads as noise and goes. Not `// must be non-empty` but `// empty here means the regex matched nothing and ctest exits 0 having run no tests - see tests/CMakeLists.txt:47`.
- **Minimal.** One or two concise lines, reasons in order of importance.
- **Don't justify the obvious.** Well-named code is self-documenting. Reserve comments for non-obvious decisions: workarounds, performance choices, security rationale, external-system constraints.
- **Document public interfaces.** Functions, classes, modules other code depends on get a brief docstring or header: purpose, parameters, return values, notable failure modes.

---

## Testing guidance

Every code change ends with a short **Testing** section:

1. **List edge cases ranked by severity** (most dangerous first): empty inputs, boundary values, malformed data, concurrent access, resource exhaustion, permission failures, network timeouts, injection attempts. Evaluate severity yourself - the user may share the output, and you can't assume others will catch edge cases you miss.
2. **Concrete test commands or steps** - copy-pasteable. Use the language's built-in test runner; if none, a minimal script or manual steps.
3. **State what "pass" looks like** for each test. The user shouldn't have to guess whether the output is correct.
4. **Keep it brief.** A few well-chosen tests on critical paths and the nastiest edge cases beat an exhaustive list nobody will run.
5. **Verify LLM-generated code independently.** Any LLM output (this skill included) can contain subtle security flaws, incorrect API usage, or hallucinated function names. Run static analysis (`bandit` for Python, `eslint-plugin-security` for JavaScript, `cargo clippy` for Rust); test every security-sensitive path manually.

---

## Code review mode

When reviewing existing code, evaluate against all principles above and report findings in this order:

1. **Security** - anything exploitable.
2. **Bugs** - logic errors, off-by-one, race conditions, resource leaks.
3. **Efficiency** - duplicated work, unnecessary allocations, poor algorithm choice.
4. **Maintainability** - unclear naming, tangled logic, missing error handling.
5. **Style and minor** - only if the above are clean.

Each finding states what the problem is, why it matters, and how to fix it. Corrected snippet if the fix is non-obvious. If the code is sound, say so; don't invent problems.

### Review recommendations file

After completing a review, produce a self-contained markdown file for download - someone reading it without the conversation should understand every finding.

```

## What this skill is NOT for

- One-liner commands or CLI arguments.
- Choosing between tools or technologies (unless the choice has security or efficiency implications in the code being written).
- Documentation not directly attached to code.
